Hi my name is Ryan Mazzolini and this is my portfolio/blog. I am from sunny Cape Town, South Africa.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.rmazzolini.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CV-Ryan-Mazzolini.pdf">Here is a link to my CV.</a>
</p>

I am a computer programmer with an honours degree (Bsc.) in computer science from the University of Cape Town. I am currently pursuing a Msc. in computer science (also at UCT), specialising in computer graphics.

I like making computer games, programming, sound design,Â playing guitar, climbing and running. My passion is game design, and I regularly participate in 48-72hr game jams.
