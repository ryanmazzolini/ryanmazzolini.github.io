Hi my name is Ryan Mazzolini and this is my portfolio/blog. I am from sunny Cape Town, South Africa.

<p style="text-align: center;">
  <a href="http://www.rmazzolini.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/CV-Ryan-Mazzolini.pdf">Here is a link to my CV.</a>
</p>

I am a Software Engneer with an Masters degree (Msc.) in Computer Graphics from the University of Cape Town. I started off in the serious games industry making mobile/augmented reality games before moving to Amazon Web Services in EC2 where I have focused on development of APis, large distributed systems architectures, CI/CD systems and automation. 

I still make games and do game jams in my spare time but also enjoy,Â playing guitar, building guitars (new!), dabbling in analogue/digital electronics, climbing and running.
