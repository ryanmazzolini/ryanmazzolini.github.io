[For this jam](http://www.makegamessa.com/discussion/2334/city-hall-jam-growteam) we had to make a game where each persons play-through would affect the playthrough of the next player. The idea I came up with was a turn based game similar to [star seed pilgrim](http://www.starseedpilgrim.com/). The first player would place down seed blocks, while another would &#8220;grow&#8221; the seed block. I teamed up with Ben Rausch, on pixels, and Ivo Sissolak, on sound/music.
