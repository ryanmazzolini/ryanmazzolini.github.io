[Soul Searcher](http://archive.globalgamejam.org/2012/soul-searcher-0) is our entry into the 2012 Global Game Jam. We placed 2nd in the local competition and created a pretty fun platformer as a group. The group consisted of Jem Smith (art, animation and level design), Wouter De Vos (AI, some of which was lost in the final build) and myself (game logic).(missing unity attachment)
