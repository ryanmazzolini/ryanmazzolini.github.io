    Deep within the earth lies an ancient cavern. In the heart of the chamber dwells the arcane tree god Rom, who holds the Stag-Beast denizens in constant mortal combat. These Stag-Beasts must vie for Rom&#8217;s favour by sacrificing one another, and thereby satisfying his undying blood thirst.

Designed for Xbox 360, the game supports multiplayer with up to four player split screen and includes a couple of experimental mechanics as well as an originally composed soundtrack.
