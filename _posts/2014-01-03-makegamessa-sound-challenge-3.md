The Premise&#8230; You&#8217;ve started your job working on Defenders-craft making sweet sounds for the game. You are told that the game is being themed for the festive season, and as the newbie, the job falls on you to design appropriate sounds&#8230; Naturally you hate this. This goes against everything you stand for (or maybe its your irrational fear candy canes). This is the most cheesy, foul, greedy and stereotypically AAA task you&#8217;ve ever had to do.

So you&#8217;ll give them their bells, chimes, choirs and \*shudder\* candy cane clangs, but you&#8217;re not going to like it and you&#8217;re not going to do it the way they want. This is going to be festive&#8230; with a difference.Check out my entry below:
