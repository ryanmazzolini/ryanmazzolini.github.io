I have once again teamed up with [Richard Pieterse](http://www.nekropants.com/) on a game he is developing called [Escape Velocity](http://www.nekropants.com/p/escape-velocity.html) (playable on his personal website). This time around I am the creator of the music and sound effects for the game. This is the first time I have tried my hand at creating sound effects and the second time I have created music. This was thoroughly enjoyable and you can hear the music I made on SoundCloud.



This is also the first time my music has been featured somewhere, when the game went to the [Amaze festival in Berlin](http://www.amaze-indieconnect.de/2013/exhibition).
