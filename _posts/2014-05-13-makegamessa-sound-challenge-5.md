[For this challenge](http://www.makegamessa.com/discussion/2011/sound-challenge-competition-5-suspense-toward-the-light-voting-now-open-to-all-on-the-forum#Item_39) we added sound to a 1min video of a horror game.

If you don&#8217;t know Toward the light by @TheFuntastic then I strongly encourage you to play the game first! Seriously, stop reading now and go play it.

Lastly, here is my entry:
