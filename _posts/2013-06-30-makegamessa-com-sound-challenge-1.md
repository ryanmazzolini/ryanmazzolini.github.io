I decided to try organize a [Sound Challenge at MakeGamesSA](http://www.makegamessa.com/discussion/694/challenge-first-sound-design-project) and it was pretty successful for its first time (a whole three entries!). The aim of the challenge was to provide sound effects, music or both for a video clip from a game, kinda like [this](http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=mr5VtVv_fbE). The games clips chosen were of Monaco and Sumotori.

For my entry I chose the Monaco clip, check it out in the video below.
