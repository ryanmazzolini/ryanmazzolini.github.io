[For this challenge](http://www.makegamessa.com/discussion/1724/sound-challenge-competition-4-kid-friendly-voting-close-#Item_51) we added sound to a 1min video of a kid-friendly game (Little big planet). This needed to appeal to a younger crowd so needed to snap, crackle and pop with enthusiasm!

Sadly I didn&#8217;t manage to get an entry into this comp 🙁
