Hello! 

I'm Ryan Mazzolini and this is my portfolio/blog.
I'm currently based in the UK, but originally from sunny Cape Town, South Africa.

I am a Software Engineer with an Masters degree (Msc.) in Computer Graphics from the University of Cape Town. I started off in the serious games industry making mobile/augmented reality games before moving to Amazon Web Services in EC2 where I have focused on backend engineering of large distributed systems architectures, CI/CD systems and automation.

I still make games and do 48/72hr game jams in my spare time but also enjoy,Â playing guitar, building guitars (new!), dabbling in analogue/digital electronics, climbing and running.
